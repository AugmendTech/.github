## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤–

We're the Augmended -> AI (Augmen)ted (D)evs

Augmend has joined Datadog to work on Bits AI (https://www.datadoghq.com/product/platform/bits-ai/). It was nice to work with you all during our short time as a company :)

We create tools and services that make it easy for AIs and Humans to work together.

Specifically, we focus on AI Agents/Assistants working on screen based interactions,
that can be in real time on your desktop, or after the fact, "watching" and understanding a recorded video.

Our first product is available at [augmend.com](https://augmend.com), it's an intelligent screen recorder
that also auto-generates documents for you so you don't have to write it yourself. You just record or
upload a video of you talking and sharing your screen, and our AI assistant creates the documentation for you
like a how to or notetaking solution that even comes with screenshots. We also generate an assistant
that comes with your videos to answer questions about what was on screen or said, fully multimodal.

It's pretty neat, and will save your dev team time answering the same questions over and over again,
and is the only video understanding AI tool out there right now that actually understands what was on screen,
not just the spoken transcript.

Record your screen. Capture knowledge.
Your team's shared brain.

We also like to share things in open source, like CrabGrab, which you can find the code for here.

Hope you like what we have, lots more on the way as we accelerate into the future of
[AI/Human cyborg development](https://augmend.com/graggnet)!
